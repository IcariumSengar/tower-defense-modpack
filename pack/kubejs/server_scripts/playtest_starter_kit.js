// Playtest convenience only — not real pack design. On a player's first
// join to a world, gives an overpowered weapon, a full set of iron
// armor, and fills in a small starter base around their spawn point, so
// a fresh Superflat test world is immediately playable without manual
// setup each time. Armor isn't auto-equipped, just given to inventory —
// same as the sword/horn.
//
// Narratively reframed (2026-08-19) as gear looted from a previous,
// unfortunate occupant of the base — same "diary from a previous soul"
// device planned for the quest book (docs/IDEAS.md's Pack Aesthetic
// idea). Mechanically, the sword/armor disappear once wave 5 clears —
// see wave_status.js's removal logic, gated on the td_starter_gear NBT
// tag set here, not item type.
//
// Uses event.server.runCommandSilent(...) with absolute coordinates (not
// player-relative ~) since it executes from the server console, not "as"
// the player.
//
// Uses player.getX()/getY()/getZ(), not bare .x/.y/.z — confirmed in
// wave_spawner.js's debugging that the bare-property form produces NaN
// for position in this environment. This means the starter base has
// never actually been built until now (NaN coordinates -> every /fill
// and /setblock silently failed) — the sword/horn gave fine since
// Item.of(...) doesn't depend on position.

// Starter sword/armor carry a td_starter_gear:1b marker tag (plus a
// flavor Lore line) so wave_status.js can remove exactly these items
// after wave 5, not any netherite sword/iron armor the player has since
// crafted or looted legitimately — see starterGearNbt() below. The Wave
// Horn is NOT tagged; it's the core mechanic item, not narrative gear.
